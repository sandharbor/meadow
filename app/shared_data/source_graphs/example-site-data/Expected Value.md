Expected value is the weighted average of all possible outcomes, where each outcome is multiplied by its probability. It's the core tool of [[Probabilistic Thinking]] for comparing decisions under uncertainty.

## How It Works

If a bet has a 50% chance of winning $100 and a 50% chance of losing $40, the expected value is (0.5 × $100) + (0.5 × −$40) = $30. Even though you might lose on any single try, repeatedly taking bets with positive expected value is how you win over time.

## Why It Matters

Expected value forces you to weigh both the probability and the magnitude of outcomes — not just whether something "could" happen. A low-probability event with catastrophic consequences can have a large negative expected value, which is exactly why [[Margin of Safety]] matters: you're protecting against the tail of the distribution.

## Connections

[[Warren Buffett]] and [[Charlie Munger]] think in expected value constantly. Buffett looks for investments where the expected value is overwhelmingly positive — situations where the downside is limited and the upside is large. This is [[Probabilistic Thinking]] applied to capital allocation.

[[Base Rates]] provide the starting probabilities you need before you can calculate expected value. Without a realistic sense of how often outcomes occur, your expected value calculations are built on sand.

## Prompts

How do you calculate [[Expected Value]]?
?
Multiply each possible outcome by its probability, then sum them all together.

Why can a low-probability event still dominate an [[Expected Value]] calculation?
?
If the magnitude of the outcome is large enough (catastrophic loss or enormous gain), it can outweigh its low probability.
