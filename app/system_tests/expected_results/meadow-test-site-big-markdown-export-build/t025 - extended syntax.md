This page is a comprehensive enumeration of every extended markdown syntax variation from https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/. Some features (tables, fenced code blocks) are duplicated in other tests; this page is the single source of truth for the complete extended-syntax set.

## Tables

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Table Alignment

| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |
| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |

## Fenced Code Blocks

### Comments

There is a comment below this line that you will not see in the rendered output.

%%This is a hidden comment%%

And here is a block comment that spans multiple lines:

%%
This entire block
is a comment and
will not be rendered.
%%

Text continues after the comment.

Comments inside code blocks should be preserved:

```
%%This should not be stripped%%
```

Inline code too: `%%also preserved%%`

### LaTeX Math

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Block math:

$$
\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

LaTeX inside code blocks should not be transformed:

```latex
$E = mc^2$ and $$\frac{1}{2}$$
```

Inline code too: `$E = mc^2$`
